## Negative Filter / Image Inversion

* Inverting a digital image is a point processing operation.
* This is an essential and a simple filter done using Image and ImageFilter packages.
* The output of image inversion is a negative of a digital image.
* In a digital image the intensity levels vary from 0 to L-1. The negative transformation is given by s=L-1-r.
* When an image is inverted, each of its pixel value ‘r’ is subtracted from the maximum pixel value L-1 and the original pixel is replaced with the result ‘s’.
* Image inversion or Image negation helps finding the details from the darker regions of the image.
* The negative transformation has its applications in the areas of Medical Imaging, Remote Sensing and others.
* A sample output is mentioned below :
