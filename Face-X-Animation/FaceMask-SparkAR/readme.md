* A video based animation can be visualised when you test this. You can turn around your face and still the mask movement works perfectly.

# How to implement it? (Tutorial)

* Once you install Spark AR, login within your Instagram or Facebook account.
* To do this, [click](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/) here and press the Download button. Every so often you should see improvements in the software, as it is updated continually. 
* After logging in create a new project file.
* If you want to work on the pre-existing templates you can choose one from the available resources. 
* Click the button Create New to start your project. You will see that there are different screens, predesigned according to the types of filter. 
* Some, like Face Decoration and Head Decoration, incorporate 3D elements associated with the head which correspond to facial movement. Others, like World Object, offer you the possibility to integrate an object into a 3D scene.
* You can also generate make-up filters with the Makeup screen, add a background using the screen of the same name, or use the Face Mask, Color Filter and Neck Decoration functions. Another option is to start a new project from scratch; to do so, you need to select Blank Project.
* Once you have selected the new project, you’ll arrive at the View Board. Here you can see how the elements you’re adding look on the screen. 
* The camera will also appear if you activate the Camera icon, found on the Scene panel. 
* Represented by blue lines, this camera enables us to see what is inside the viewfinder.
* On the right-hand side of the screen appears a preview where we see what sort of effect our filter will have once it’s ready. 
* You can choose the type of device, rotate the image and even change the appearance of the model, choosing between different physical aspects. 
* This is particularly useful as it enables us to see how the filter adapts to different facial structures and how it is applied to effects in movement.

* We’re going to zoom in on two elements that you can add to the Scene panel and which will be very useful when you come to start creating your augmented reality filters: Face Tracker and Face Mesh. 
* Face Tracker follows the movement of our face and can be applied to all the movements we want, but our main focus is on Face Mash, a 3D mesh that adjusts to our face.
