### Demonstration of different algorithms and operations on faces

There are several approaches for recognizing a face. The algorithm can use statistics, try to find a pattern which represents a specific person or use a convolutional neural network.

The algorithms used for the tests are Eigenfaces, Fisherfacesand local binary patterns histograms which all come from the library OpenCV. Eigenfaces and Fisher faces are used with a Euclidean distance to predict the person. The algorithm which is using a deep convolutional neural network is the project called OpenFace.

This can be used for automatic face detection attendance system in recent technology.

`Recognition of faces by different algorithms and frameworks. Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made solution to implement. So In this project all kind of algorithms are implemented and even with various operations that can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only high-resolution static shots and performed insufficiently.`

## Comparative Study of the Algorithms used here :

This project holds different type of deep learning models on different frameworks. every single model has it's uniqueness and contribute vastly to the deep learning domain .
If we try to compare them, we might find better understanding over those and this would be great for all of us :)

ORB performs as well as SIFT on the task of feature detection (and is better than SURF) while being almost two orders of magnitude faster.                                                                                                                                                                    |

But, the standard LDA algorithm has difficulty in processing high dimensional image data. PCA is often used for projecting an image into a lower dimensional space and then LDA is performed to maximize the discriminatory power.                                                                                                                  |

The standard version of SURF is several times faster than SIFT and claimed by its authors to be more robust against different image transformations than SIFT. Experiments performed on Caltech's face database show that this approach detects and recognizes different faces with different illumination/expressions/backgrounds rapidly and accurately. |

A small version of NASNet achieves 74% accuracy, which is 3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. The large NASNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while halving the computational cost of the best reported result on arxiv.org.                                          |

Therefore, Xception is more efficient than Inception v3 model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Whereas most machine learning-based object categorization algorithms require training on hundreds or thousands of samples, one-shot learning aims to classify objects from one, or only a few, samples.                                                                                                                                                   |

Joachims                                         | 2003       | Triplet loss is a loss function for machine learning algorithms where a reference input (called anchor) is compared to a matching input (called positive) and a non-matching input (called negative). The distance from the anchor to the positive is minimized, and the distance from the anchor to the negative input is maximized.This makes it much better than the Contrastive loss Function .                                               |
