# 3D-Face-Movements

## - About :

<p>Controlling 3D character's Face Movements using OpenCV and Python üêç </p>
<p>It's a python script to control a 3d character's face movements by capturing user's face landmarks.</p>
<p>First time I am trying to build 3D Pipeline-- Modeling , animation using OpenCV & Blender Open Source 3D creation suite .
  Face Movements are not perfect but I‚Äôm happy to learn new thing . üò¨üòé</p>
 
## - Working :
<p> A 3D model is essentially made up of vertices, which come together to form a mesh and act as the core of the 3D model. Each point on the model can be manipulated to change the shape. By using coordinate data, the software identifies the location of each vertical and horizontal point, all relative to a reference point.</p>
<p>

## - Installation :

1. Download Blender [HERE](https://www.blender.org/download/)
2. Install Requirement Modules <br>
      - Mac OS : open the Terminal
```
        cd "cd /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.81/python/bin"
          ./python3.7m -m ensurepip
          ./python3.7m -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
          ./python3.7m -m pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy --user
```
